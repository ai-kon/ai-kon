## üéØ Mission

**Replacing human labor with autonomous AI systems while making the world better through interactive world models.**

AI-KON is pioneering two revolutionary concepts:

1. **ü§ñ Autonomous AI Workforce** - A self-operating company where AI handles everything from planning to execution
2. **üåç Interactive World Models** - A game-like simulation environment where AI trains and humans play

## üèóÔ∏è Two Pillars

### 1. AI Labor Replacement

A hierarchical multi-agent system:

```
CEO (Human) ‚Üí Planning AI ‚Üí Command AI ‚Üí Execution AI ‚Üí Physical AI
```

- **Planning AI**: Strategic decisions, resource allocation
- **Command AI**: Task assignment, coordination
- **Execution AI**: Code generation, research, analysis, content creation
- **Physical AI**: Robotics, IoT, real-world automation

**Goal**: 80%+ of all company operations automated by Year 3

### 2. World Model Simulation

An interactive environment where:
- **AI agents train** using imagination-based learning (no real-world data needed)
- **Humans play** and generate valuable training data
- **Both benefit** from a game-like experience that improves AI capabilities

**Technology**:
- Based on [Hunyuan-GameCraft](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan-GameCraft-1.0) for video generation
- Inspired by ["Training Agents Inside Scalable World Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24527)
- Real-time interactive gameplay at 25 FPS
